# Proxy Pattern Example â€” Cached Video Downloader

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project demonstrates the **Proxy Design Pattern** using a simple example: downloading videos with caching.  
Instead of downloading the same video multiple times, the proxy stores it in a cache and serves it instantly on repeated requests.

## ðŸ›  Pattern Used
**Proxy Pattern** â€” A structural design pattern that acts as a substitute or placeholder for another object, controlling access to it.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `IVideoDownloader` â€” Interface for the downloader.
- `RealVideoDownloader` â€” Simulates downloading a video (slow process).
- `CachedVideoDownloaderProxy` â€” Adds caching to avoid repeated downloads.
- `Program.cs` â€” Demonstrates usage.

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. First request â†’ Downloads the video and stores it in cache.
2. Second request for the same URL â†’ Served instantly from cache.

## ðŸ’» Example Output
```
ðŸ“¥ Downloading video from: https://video.com/1
âœ… Download complete.

ðŸ“¥ Downloading video from: https://video.com/2
âœ… Download complete.

Serving video from cache: https://video.com/1
```

## â–¶ Run
